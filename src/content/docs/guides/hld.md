## Abstract

Inefficient employee attendance systems often fail to accurately track individual employee activities, which can make it challenging to evaluate employee performance and provide appropriate promotions. To address this issue, we propose the development of an advanced computer vision system named "Company Work Environment Management." This system creates attendance records based on employee arrival and departure times, as well as tracking individual activities throughout the day, such as working, talking on the phone, or looking away from their system.

One of the most significant aspects of this system is its commitment to data privacy, as it only collects mathematical representations of employee data, which can be used for prediction and model evaluation but cannot be used to recreate the original images or faces. This project aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of employee attendance systems, making it easier to evaluate employee performance and provide appropriate promotions.

## 2. General Description

### 2.1 Project Perspective

The proposed computer vision system, named "Company Work Environment Management", uses advanced face recognition technology to improve employee attendance tracking and performance evaluation. It also utilizes a Cassandra NoSQL database to store and analyze employee activity data. The system offers a modern and efficient solution to traditional attendance tracking and enhances the overall work environment management process. The system uses Machine learning for predictions and Deep Learning for detection.

### 2.2 Problem Statement

To create an AI Solution for Employee work and attendance and activity tracker we need to implement the following use cases:
- To detect faces and classify them and add them to record.
- To identify pose and classify them into predefined activities like talking on phone, looking away from screen, working, etc.
- Manages a database with daily as well as total activity records.

### 2.3 Proposed Solution

#### Data collection Face

**Version 1:**

For data collection, the solution proposed here is using mediapipe to get the coordinates of facial landmarks which consist of 468 3D face landmarks. The landmarks consist of x,y,z coordinates of individual features of the face along with visibility confidence. And store them on a csv file for training. The idea here is using these coordinates to train a model with these data points along with labels.

**Version 2:**

For data collection, the solution proposed here is using a computer vision system to detect a face using Mtcnn or Dllib and crop the faces from the rest of the background and get the facial embeddings using facenet to get the mathematical representations of facial features and save the embeddings on csv.

For face detection libraries can be used:

**MTCNN:**
Mtcnn detects the face in three stages to acquire greater confidence and accuracy but with the tradeoff of requiring more computational power.

**HaarCascade:**
HaarCascase requires less computational power hence they are faster but they tend to give some False Positives.

**Getting Embeddings:**
We can use the facenet library on cropped faces to get face embeddings.

For training:

**Artificial Neural Network (ANN):**
- Pros: ANNs can learn highly complex relationships, and can achieve high accuracy. They can generalize well to new data and are well suited for data with high dimensions.
- Cons: ANNs can be computationally expensive and require more processing power hence real-time prediction canâ€™t be achieved. They are prone to overfitting and can be trained on noise of complex data.

**K-nearest Neighbors (KNN):**
- Pros: KNN compares the current tuple of the dataset (face in our case) to each face in the registry and outputs the most similar face, which can be an ideal solution for the problem.
- Cons: KNN is a non-trainable model and calculates the distances at the time of prediction which can be computationally slow when more faces are present in the registry.

**Support Vector Machine (SVM):**
- Pros: SVMs can work well for problems involving distance metrics. They are commonly used in classification tasks where the goal is to separate data points into different classes or categories. SVMs are lightweight for prediction because they only have to calculate for k numbers (number of data points that can separate the classified group) of data points defined at the time of training. They have less tradeoff between accuracy and performance.

#### Data Collection for Pose

**Mediapipe:**
Mediapipe pose landmarks contain 33 3D landmarks for individual points just like face mesh. Consist of X,Y,Z, visibility confidence which are then stored on csv file along with class name.

Training: ANN, KNN, and SVM can also be used here with their performances and accuracy tradeoff keeping in mind.

#### Hosting

Before the prediction part, we first need to host the web application that runs preprocess the testing (live) data and sends the data for prediction.

We will create a Flask web application with python and javascript to capture the webcam for Face > Pose > Preprocessing > Prediction > Database Management pipeline.

We can use such hosting platforms:
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Microsoft Azure
- Heroku
- Replit

#### Data Collection for Prediction

**Face:**

**Version 1:**

We detect landmarks using Mediapipe pose library and sent the landmarks tuple for prediction without storing real image.

**Version 2:**

We first detect the face coordinates with MTCNN or Dllib and crop the required by facenet to get embeddings and sent the embeddings tuple for prediction.

For face detection libraries can be used:

**MTCNN:**
Mtcnn detects the face in three stages to acquire greater confidence and accuracy but with the tradeoff of requiring more computational power.

**HaarCascade:**
HaarCascase requires less computational power hence they are faster but they tend to give some False Positives.

**Getting Embeddings:**
We can use the facenet library on cropped faces to get face embeddings.

**Database:**

Once the prediction result is obtained, it is sent to the database pipeline along with the duration. The database pipeline follows a basic structure:

1. After getting the prediction result, check if the pose or face is not updating.
2. Calculate the duration for the current pose for the same face and keep track of the duration.
3. When the user performs the next pose or the face changes, then add the previous pose along with face (user name) and duration the user performed before the current action.
4. Check if the user is present for today's record table and update or add new records accordingly with the current date and time.
5. For every action performed, update the record of the user with adding the duration calculated before new prediction and sum that up on that pose column.
6. Update the "end time" column to indicate the time when the last record was captured, after which no further records will be added to the end time column.
7. Update the Total record table with the total duration of actions performed by the user every day.
8. In summary, the database pipeline ensures accurate tracking and recording of user actions and durations, while also updating relevant tables in the database.

### 2.4 Further Improvements

Ability to capture employee emotions. This feature can be useful in ensuring that employees are happy and satisfied with their work environment. By analyzing facial expressions, the system can identify when an employee is feeling stressed or unhappy and alert management to take appropriate action. This can include providing additional support, changing work assignments, or addressing any other issues that may be affecting employee happiness. Capturing emotions can also help identify areas where the work environment could be improved to enhance employee satisfaction and productivity. Additionally, analyzing emotions can enable management to identify employees who may be at risk of burnout or other mental health issues and take proactive measures to address these concerns. Overall, this feature can enhance the system's ability to promote employee well-being and job satisfaction.

### 2.5 Technical Requirement

The technical requirements for the proposed computer vision system are as follows:

**Hardware:** The system will require a camera and a computer with decent performance. The camera should have a resolution of at least 720p and a decent frame rate to capture accurate facial data.
